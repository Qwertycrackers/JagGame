This is the JagGame library, a compilation of personal tools I've developed to make games using the SDL library.
It is now on Github, because it was honestly just pretentious of me to hide some extremely simple code, and because I would
like potential employers to be able to browse it.

Anyone is, of course, welcome to use this library if it actually helps them, and all questions/contributions/interactions are appreciated.
